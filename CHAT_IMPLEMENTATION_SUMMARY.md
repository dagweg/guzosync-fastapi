## üîß WebSocket Events Added

### For Field Staff (Bus Drivers & Queue Regulators)
```javascript
// Create support conversation
{
  "type": "create_support_conversation",
  "data": {
    "title": "Route Change Request",
    "content": "I need assistance with my route"
  }
}

// Send chat message
{
  "type": "send_chat_message", 
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "content": "Hello, I need help"
  }
}

// Get active conversations
{
  "type": "get_active_conversations",
  "data": {}
}
```

### For Control Staff/Admin
```javascript
// Join support room for monitoring
{
  "type": "join_support_room",
  "data": {
    "room_type": "general_support"
  }
}

// Get conversation messages
{
  "type": "get_conversation_messages",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "limit": 50,
    "skip": 0
  }
}
```

### Universal Events
```javascript
// Join conversation room
{
  "type": "join_conversation",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123"
  }
}

// Typing indicator
{
  "type": "typing_indicator",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "is_typing": true
  }
}

// Mark message as read
{
  "type": "mark_message_read",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "message_id": "msg_456"
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Real-time Notifications

### Automatic Notifications
- **New Support Conversations** - Control staff get notified when field staff create support requests
- **New Messages** - All conversation participants receive real-time message updates
- **Typing Indicators** - Show when someone is typing
- **Read Receipts** - Confirm when messages are read

### Support Room Broadcasts
- Control staff in support rooms receive notifications about new conversations
- Role-specific rooms get targeted notifications (driver issues ‚Üí driver support room)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- JWT token required for WebSocket connection
- User role verification for all operations

### Authorization
- Field staff can only create conversations with control center
- Control staff can join support rooms and respond to any conversation they're part of
- Users can only access conversations they're participants in

### Data Validation
- All message content is validated
- Conversation access is verified before any operation
- Role-based permissions enforced at every level

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### Existing Models Used
- **User** - For authentication and role checking
- **Conversation** - For chat conversation management
- **Message** - For message persistence

### Database Operations
- Automatic conversation creation with all control staff as participants
- Message persistence with real-time delivery
- Conversation history retrieval with pagination

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Run the server**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Create test users** with appropriate roles (BUS_DRIVER, QUEUE_REGULATOR, CONTROL_STAFF, CONTROL_ADMIN)
3. **Run demo script**: `python examples/chat_demo.py`

### Test Scenarios Covered
- Support conversation creation by field staff
- Real-time message exchange
- Support room monitoring by control staff
- Typing indicators and read receipts
- Message history retrieval
- Role-based access control

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Frontend Integration
1. Connect to WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8000/api/websocket/connect?token=JWT_TOKEN`
2. Send events using the documented JSON format
3. Listen for real-time events and update UI accordingly
4. Handle authentication and error responses

### For Field Staff UI
- Show "Contact Support" button that creates new conversations
- Display active conversations list
- Real-time chat interface with typing indicators
- Message history loading

### For Control Staff UI  
- Support dashboard showing all active requests
- Real-time notifications for new support conversations
- Multi-conversation management interface
- Role-specific filtering (driver vs regulator issues)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible. Potential additions:
- File attachments in messages
- Voice/video calling integration
- Message reactions and threading
- Push notifications for mobile apps
- Advanced message search and filtering
- Conversation analytics and reporting

## ‚úÖ Ready for Production

The implementation includes:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for monitoring
- ‚úÖ Role-based security
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ Real-time delivery
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Testing scripts
- ‚úÖ Example implementations

The chat system is now fully functional and ready for frontend integration!
